title: Extending Premake
---

A collection of how-to articles on extending and improving Premake. These are intended for folks who want to add new actions or API functions to Premake. If you just want to script your projects, have a look at [Scripting with Premake](Scripting_With_Premake) instead.

This section is very much a work in progress, which I hope to gradually build up over time.
